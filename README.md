## InspireQ (Inspirational Quotes App)

The concept behind InspireQ¬†is to create an inspirational quotation software where users may exchange "Inspirational Quotes" with other members and receive comments.
Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 are the technologies used in the program. It also makes use of Test Driven Development techniques.

## Project description
InspireQ is also a Social Media Platform that offers its user the ability to motivate their followers through the use of inspirational quotes.
Users have the ability to:

- post new inspirational quotes
- make friends and get followers
- reply to quotes of other following users
- share ideas (like and unlike, comment)
- update and delete quotes
- follow and unfollow users
- make friends and unfriends users

This project was achieved using the following: Ruby on Rails, HTML5, Bootstrap, CSS3 and JavaScript, SASS.

I created a special Inspiring Quotations App for this project, where users may submit inspirational quotes, like them, and follow them.

### Usage

When you visit the link in your browser, you'll be asked to log in before you can see your quotes and those of your friends.

You may create an account by clicking the "Sign Up" button and filling in the required fields.

You can now write your own quotation and share it with your friends! For the time being, if you don't have any friends, you can simply follow the other users. It's all about networking!

Furthermore, the 'Discover' and 'Profile' items in the left panel allow you to see all users as well as your own profile!
